# djangolang_example

# status: under development

This repo contains an example usage of [djangolang](https://github.com/initialed85/djangolang) in a toy project.

## Goals

I'm planning for this repo to show the following:

- A local development environment
  - Dependencies handled by Docker Compose
  - An example database schema that works well with Djangolang
  - Bash tooling to generate a Djangolang API from the database

## Usage

```shell
./build.sh
```
